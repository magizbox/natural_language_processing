## Natural Language Processing

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages.

> NLP is related to the area of humanâ€“computer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve: natural language understanding, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input; and others involve natural language generation.

> The input and output of an NLP system can be either speech or written text.

**Components of NLP**

There are two components of NLP as given

* *Natural Language Understanding (NLU)*: this task mapping the given input in natural language into useful representations and analyzing different aspects of the language.
* *Natural Language Generation (NLG)*: In the process of producing meaningful phrases and sentences in the form of natural language form some internal representation. It involves *text planning* retrieve the relevant content from knowledge base, *sentence planning* choose required words, forming meaningful phrases, setting tone of the sentence, *text realization* map sentence plan into sentence structure.

**Difficulties**

Natural Language has an extremely rich form and structure. It is very ambiguous. There can be different levels of ambiguity

* *Lexical ambiguity*: it is at very primitive level such as word-level. For example, treating the word "board" as noun or verb?
* *Syntax level ambiguity*: A sentence be parsed in different ways. For example, "He lifted the beetle with the red cap?" - did he use cap to lift the beetle or he lifted a beetle that had red cap?
* *Referential ambiguity*: referring to something using pronouns. For example, Rima went to Gauri. She said "I am tired". - Exactly who is tired?
* One input can mean different meanings.
* Many inputs can mean the same thing.
